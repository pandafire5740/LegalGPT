# Current

# Future
* Let's look at injecting our VectorStore instead of constructing a new wrapper each time we need it
* contextassembler._gather_inventory should probably live in the vectorstore itself (and is potentially just a metadata search)
* Let's look at assemble_context from the perspective of context window pollution/management
* Let's change the detect_intent function to be a multi-round tool-calling flow instead
* Let's DRY up chat_query_stream and chat_query
* Let's remove ai_service.py and remaining usages

# Complete
* ~~We probably don't need both FAISS and ChromaDB for vector searches. Let's use Chroma everywhere~~ ✅
* ~~Getting the error NameError: name 'user_query' is not defined when using /chat/query/stream~~ ✅
